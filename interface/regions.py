"""
Regions are a section of a screen. They are basically a set width and height,
in screen columns and rows, that has been "set aside". The basic
:class:`Region` takes a two co-ordinates: ``start`` and ``stop``. You can then
pass any shape or shape-like object to the Region's :func:`Region.blit`
function.

Extensions of the base Region include :class:`MessageRegion`, whose primary
entry-point is through a list of strings which are outputted to the screen, and
:class:`ViewPortRegion`, whose main purpose is to provide a way of positioning
a ViewPort on the screen.

Finally, there exists :class:`VariableRegion` and variable variations of
:class:`MessageRegion` and :class:`ViewPortRegion`, which allow you to specify
a starting location as well as a percentage of width and screen height the
region should take up.
